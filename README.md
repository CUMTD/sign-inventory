# Sign Inventory

This is an internal web app for auditing the condition of bus stop signs, shelters and amenities, for use by MTD's planning department. The app is built on top of NextJS, and communicates with a .NET EF Core API to read/write an SQL database. The application displays data points like sign condition, general notes, photos, accessibility features and more.

## Architecture Overview

The app is written in typescript upon the **NextJS app router framework**. It was bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. Application states are managed by the [**Recoil**](https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/motivation) library. The UI is built with a mixture of **React** and **MUI** (formerly called material UI). Authentication is handled with the **next-auth**.

This app will only function with the sign inventory API running, therefore allowing communication with the `mtdsql4` SignInventory database. More info can be found at the API's README.

## Getting things running

1. Ensure all environment variables are set and the sign inventory API is running (see "Environment Variables" above)
2. `yarn install` to install all dependencies
3. `yarn dev` to start the development server (Ctrl+C to stop)
4. `yarn build` to build the app for production
5. `yarn start` to start the production server (Ctrl+C to stop)

Once the app is running, you can access it at `localhost:3000`.

## Current deployment info

Sign Inventory is currently deployed through MTD's [Vercel](vercel.com/) account. Pushes to this repo's `main` branch will trigger a new deployment.
